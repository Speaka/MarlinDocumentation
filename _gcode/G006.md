Direct Stepping allows a host device to issue direct stepper movements that are defined in a binary format that is written ahead of time by the host device to a page in the device RAM.

The mechanism provided for loading the binary data onto the device is the "page manager". The page manager provided here uses a parallel protocol over the USB serial connection to write pages to the device RAM, and is decoupled from the normal serial g-code pipeline. This allows the host device to preload pages as fast as possible without waiting on the g-code pipeline.

Once a page is written by the device, it can be triggered using the G6 g-code which references the page index that should be used for that move. Depending on the page format, direction arguments may need to be provided in the G6 code.

Wiki: Perform a direct, uninterpolated, and non-kinematic synchronized move of one or more steppers directly. Units may be linear (e.g., mm or inches on DELTA) or specified in degrees (SCARA). This command is useful for initialization, diagnostics, and calibration, and should be disabled on production equipment. This type of move can be potentially dangerous, especially for deltabots, so implementations should do their best to limit movement to prevent twerking and damaging the carriage assembly.

G6 direct stepping significantly reduces motion calculations, increases top printing speeds, and results in less step aliasing by calculating all motions in advance. Preparing your G-code: https://github.com/colinrgodsey/step-daemon
