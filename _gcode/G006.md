Wiki: Perform a direct, uninterpolated, and non-kinematic synchronized move of one or more steppers directly. Units may be linear (e.g., mm or inches on DELTA) or specified in degrees (SCARA). This command is useful for initialization, diagnostics, and calibration, and should be disabled on production equipment. This type of move can be potentially dangerous, especially for deltabots, so implementations should do their best to limit movement to prevent twerking and damaging the carriage assembly.

G6 direct stepping significantly reduces motion calculations, increases top printing speeds, and results in less step aliasing by calculating all motions in advance. Preparing your G-code: https://github.com/colinrgodsey/step-daemon
